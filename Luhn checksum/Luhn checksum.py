    Luhn Checksum - Thomas Eggleston 2016
    
    This program checks to see whether a given integer validates using the Luhn
    formula. For a number to be valid, all of the digits in the number are 
    summed together and must be divisible by 10. From the rightmost digit, every
    second digit is doubled and if the product is greater than or equal to 10, 
    then the two digits are added together.
    
    In this implementation, the checksum is calculated after each digit of the
    number is processed, and the length of the number is assumed to be unknown 
    as if there is a stream of digits.

# Problems to solve
# 
# 1. Knowing which digits to double
# 2. Treating doubled numbers 10 and greater according to their digits
# 3. Knowing we've reached the end of the number
# 4. Reading each digit separately

# 1. Store two ongoing checksums, since either may be end up being correct.
# 2. Need to check whether a digit is greater than or equal to 5. If it is 5 or
#    greater, then after doubling: subtract 10 and add 1, and add this number to 
#    checksum.
# 3. After adding most recent digit(s), check whether the sum is divisible by 10
#    ie. sum % 10 == 0.
# 4. Convert the integer into a string, which may be iterated through. Trying to 
#    simulate a stream of integers.
